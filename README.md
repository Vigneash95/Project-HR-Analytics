# Project-HR-Analytics

People Analytics is gaining significance in the world of analytics. It is concerned with employees of a company and making sure that the company tackles any issues related to its employees. 

In this project, we aim to find out factors that affect an employee's perspective of a company. I have included the dataset that was used as well. We also wanted to find out to what prompts an employee to leave the company and to see if we could predict the churn rate.
